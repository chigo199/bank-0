    <P>Most of us can’t purchase a purchase a propperty without taking out a mortgage, but while they can supply support to step onto the property ladder, there are also a few potential disadvantages to consider.</p>
     Purchasing a property can ususally be a  substantial financial decision thorughout life, and for most of us that can refer to receiveing a mortgage. Mortgages can mean relatively low cost, long term borrowing, but with such substantial sums involved, it can be vital to find out  deal tht can be appropiate.</p> 
    
    
     Should I take out a mortgage?
     If you’re looking to purchase a home, unless you can afford to pay for it completely, you’ll need to borrow – and that typically refers to a mortgage. But before deciding whether to try and obtain a mortgage there are some considerations.</p>
    
   
   <p> What value of a home can you afford? 
    The size of property you’ll be able to purchase depends on how much deposit you can put down and a certain amount you can be ablee to borrow from a mortgage lender. Each lender will have its own a;;pcated criteria, for example lending four-and-a-half times your salary.</p>
    
    However, a certain amount you can be able to borrow may depend on other factors such as the credit rating, your income and regular expenses. Delaying a mortgage m may be a wiser thing 
    if your unable to to borrow a certain amount.</p> 
    
    <P>How much that can be spent at the beginning interval? 
    The size of your cash deposit towards your property purchase may refer to the size of the mortgage you’ll need. The higher your deposit, the less that could be required to borrow and the less overall interest you’ll have to pay.</P> 
    
    <p>A substantial deposit will also refer to potentially owning a larger share of the property completely  which is classisifed as equity which generally refers to you’ll be able to  better mortgage (with lower interest rates) deal too.</p>
    <P>What form of mortgage should I receive? 
    The form of mortgage you choose comes down to personal preference and a mentality towards risk. Fixed rate mortgage deals are popular with buyers who are tryign to acheive security of knowing what their outgoings will be every month, although you might pay a tiny extra amount for that peace of mind.
    
    Borrowers who think interest rates might fall may prefer a discounted variable rate or tracker mortgage. You also have choices over the length of the mortgage. A standard mortgage term is 25 years, but you can often extend this to 30 years and even longer – depending on your age and the policy of the lender. A longer term will mean your monthly repayments will be lower but you’ll pay more interest overall.
    </P>
   
    <p> What if you intend to pay off the mortgage early? 
    It’s worth considering what will happen if you think you might be able to pay off the mortgage early because most mortgages have early repayment costs that may take place if you want to pay off the loan within the introductory time frame.</p> 
    
    Initial deals are seemingly two, three or five years, so try to take in account in how the financial situation could change. Are you likely to intend to relocate house, for example, or will you want to pay off a chunk of your loan? 
    
    What if you can’t afford the mortgage?
    Lenders will  probably to aim  to complete affordability checks to be confident that you can porbabaly afford the monthly repayments on a new mortgage. But you should also be happy with the numbers and be happy you can afford the loan.  
    
    If you feel you might struggle, then consider trying to  improve the financial before committing to a mortgage or consider borrowing less by opting for a cheaper property. 
    Advantages of a mortgage
    Makes owning a home possible 
    For many people taking out a mortgage loan makes a property affordable because it would take too long to save up. A mortgage allows you to spread the cost over many years. 
    
    Flexibility and choice 
    There are many different types of mortgages available, so you can often find one to suit your situation and personal preferences. These include fixed rate deals or variable rates and the opportunity to have a longer mortgage term to keep repayments lower.
    
    Government support
    The Government has introduced a number of schemes in recent years under its Help to Buy banner to help first-time buyers in particular get onto the property ladder. It means buyers can take advantage of shared ownership and equity loans, for example, to buy homes with a smaller cash deposit. 
    
    Disadvantages of a mortgage
    Pay back more than you borrow 
    As with all loans, you’ll need to pay back the capital you owe, plus interest. While interest rates can be relatively low on mortgages (compared to some loans and credit cards, for example) you’ll still be paying interest over the long term which will add up – with some mortgage deals being as long as 30 years.
    
    There may be fees and additional costs 
    It’s not just the interest rate you need to try and focuse on, in referecne to a mortgage, you also may be required to factor in any mortgage costs, such as arrangement fees, valuation fees, remortgaging fees (if you’re remortgaging) and conveyancing costs. If you are tryiing to pay off your mortgage early, you may also face an early repayment charge.
    
    The  home is at risk if you can’t keep up with repayments
    Because a mortgage is secured against the value of your property, if the situation changes and you cannot afford the repayments your home may be repossessed to clear the debt. If your financial circumstances change and you are struggling to pay the repayments then speak to your lender as soon as possible because they might be able to help by allowing you to pause payments for a time to give you some breathing space, or even restructure your deal to make it more affordable.
